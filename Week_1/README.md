**#1 Project: Visual Data Analysis** - inspired by the animated graph of [Hans Rosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo)

In this project, I visually analyzed the Gapminder Dataset and used a pandas library to read the data and draw histograms as well as matplotlib to create the scatterplot.

Skills acquired during the following project: 

- Applied the Bash Command Line to manage my project environment. 
- Completed GitHub basics tutorial. 
- Learnt to work with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib packages.
